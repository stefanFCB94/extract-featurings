Extract song featurings from a title, which has the format "Songtitle (feat. artist1, artist2 & artist3)".

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

The module has no further productive dependencies.

Install the module with npm to use it in your project.
```

```

To change the code or run test of the module you can install it with its development dependencies:

After installing the module can be used the following way:

const title: string = 'Title (feat. artist1, artist2 & artist3)';

// Extract the featurings from the song title
const featurings: Featuring = feat.readFeaturing(title);

// Logs the following result:
